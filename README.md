# EE5111-Practical-Deep-Learning-with-Bayesian-Principles

In this project we used a Bayesian method **VOGN** with **Active learning** and compared the results of the same with **Adam**.

Initially we used 2D datasets like **Moon** and **Circle** from scikit-learn. We were able to show how quick VOGN was able to reach high accuracy when compared to Adam. After such astounding results in 2D datasets, we replicated the same on MNIST dataset.
